We have worked on the BlackFriday Dataset and used various ML algorithms to predict the money spent by users.
The dataset gives the information about the money the customer spent on the sales depending on various
features like age, occupation, stay in the current city, marital status, etc.
Various ML algorithms like Linear Regression, SVR, Random Forest Regressor are used and their performance is evaluated, the best performing algorithm was Random Forest Regressor.
